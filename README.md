<h1>How does it work?</h1>
The Phobia Censor parses the HTML document for all image tags and then uses the Microsoft Computer Vision API to determine a list of tags for the images. It then cross checks those tags with the user's list of phobias and blocks out all of the content that may resemble the phobia and thus makes internet browsing safe for all!
